In the Topography orbit, the spacecraft will move closer to Psyche to create high-resolution maps of its surface. Using its multispectral imager, Psyche will generate detailed 3D models to reveal variations in terrain, including craters, ridges, and possible metallic features. Scientists will analyze these structures to gain insights into Psycheâ€™s geologic history, including whether it formed as the exposed core of a planetesimal or through other processes in the early solar system. Due to changing illumination of the asteroid this orbit is split into and B1 and B2 phase where B1 will take place after orbit A and the B2 phase will take place after orbits C and D.
