In the Topography orbit, the spacecraft will move closer to Psyche to create high-resolution maps of its surface. Using its multispectral imager and laser altimeter, Psyche will generate detailed 3D models to reveal variations in terrain, including craters, ridges, and possible metallic features. Scientists will analyze these structures to gain insights into Psycheâ€™s geologic history, including whether it formed as the exposed core of a protoplanet or through other processes in the early solar system.
