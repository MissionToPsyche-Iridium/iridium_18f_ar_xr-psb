During Orbit B, the multispectral imager captures detailed images of Psyche’s surface in multiple wavelengths. This allows scientists to distinguish different minerals based on how they reflect light. Additionally,  the imager’s high resolution helps create precise 3D models of surface features such as craters, ridges, and metallic deposits.
