In Orbit D—the closest orbit—the gamma-ray spectrometer focuses on elemental mapping by detecting gamma-rays generated by cosmic-ray interactions with Psyche’s surface. This instrument identifies and quantifies key elements, such as iron and nickel, by analyzing the energy signatures of the emitted gamma-rays. This detailed compositional data is critical for understanding whether Psyche is the remnant core of a disrupted planetesimal or a unique metal-rich body.
