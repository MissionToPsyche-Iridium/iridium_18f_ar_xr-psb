During Orbit C, the X-band radio system is utilized for gravity science investigations. It works by sending radio waves between the spacecraft and Earth. By precisely measuring the Doppler shifts in these radio signals, scientists can detect tiny changes in the spacecraft’s velocity caused by variations in Psyche’s gravitational pull. These measurements help map the mass distribution and internal structure of the asteroid.
