In Orbit A, the magnetometer is tasked with measuring the magnetic field around Psyche with high precision. This instrument records the strength and direction of the magnetic field in three dimensions, which is crucial for detecting subtle magnetic anomalies. These anomalies can provide clues about the asteroidâ€™s past, such as whether it once hosted a molten metallic core or experienced significant impacts that altered its magnetic signature.
