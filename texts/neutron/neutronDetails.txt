In Orbit D, the neutron spectrometer measures the major elemental composition of Psyche by detecting neutrons that are emitted when cosmic rays interact with the asteroid’s surface. Equipped with multiple filters, this instrument can differentiate between neutrons of various energy levels, which correspond to different elements. When used alongside the multispectral imager, the spectrometer’s data helps build a comprehensive picture of Psyche’s mineral and elemental makeup.
