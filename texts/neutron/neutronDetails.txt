During Orbit B of the NASA Psyche mission, the neutron spectrometer measures the major-element composition of the Psyche asteroid by detecting neutron energy from the asteroid using sensors equipped with three different filters. Alongside the multispectral imager, this instrument allows the spacecraft to gather contextual, topographical, and mineralogical data using visible to near-infrared wavelength image maps.
