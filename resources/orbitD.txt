In its closest orbit, Psyche will conduct in-depth elemental mapping to determine the asteroid’s chemical composition. Using its gamma-ray and neutron spectrometer, the spacecraft will detect key elements such as iron, nickel, and other materials that may hint at Psyche’s origins. These measurements will help scientists assess whether the asteroid is the remnant core of a failed planet or a unique type of metal-rich body, offering a glimpse into the building blocks of planetary formation.
